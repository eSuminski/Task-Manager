# Documentation Standards

- Use clear, concise language.
- Reference related code or APIs where relevant.
- Use `#` for the main title, `##` for sections, etc. Do not skip heading levels.
- Leave a blank line before and after headings, lists, and code blocks.
- Use consistent heading capitalization throughout the document (# Example Header With Capitalization).
- Use consistent list markers and indentation (prefer `-` for unordered lists).
- No trailing spaces or multiple consecutive blank lines.
- Prefer relative links for files within the repository.
- Use Markdownlint to check formatting and style compliance.
- Update `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` for all new features or fixes.
